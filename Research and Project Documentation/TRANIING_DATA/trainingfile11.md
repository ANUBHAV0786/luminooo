we need to wrrite this file again as the work was changed and it was confusing so this video need to be learned again  


STEP 11 :: we're going to create the React app using the bootstrap template 

Now we first create the main.component.js file inside the component file 



now we need to add bootstrap 
        for that we will open index.html of our Public folder inside frontend folder

        then we go to botstrap download page and copy paste from JS.deliver in Index.html page

        we can save the link also in our folder but we're by passing it bcz inlast we  will follow npm install bootstrap


Now we add NAvbar go to same getbootstrap.com as we're using bootstrap container and we will add our Navbar

so we will copy Naavbar code and paste it in the Home.components.js 

now we change class to className every where for the better DOM structure and readability
